# LiaNG

This is a software for the next generation of Liam, called LiaNG. 

Take care, this software is still in an early stage and is incomplete, buggy and... well... pre-alpha.

Fork it at you own risk, major refactoring is likely :)

The code is prepared for development in VSCode/PlatformIO, but will work in other IDE altough when you get the library depencies sorted out.

You need to:
1. Compile and upload the program

2. Upload the files in /data to the SPFISS area.

3. Connect to the temporary wifi accesspoint provided by LiaNG.

4. Surf to http://10.0.2.1/settings.html and enter your Wifi connection details.

5. After successful connection to the wifi LiaNG will report its IP in the serial and on the display if you have one connected.
