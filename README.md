# LiaNG

This is a software for the next generation of Liam, called LiaNG. 

Take care, this software is still in an early stage and is incomplete, buggy and... well... pre-alpha.

Fork it at you own risk, major refactoring is likely :)

You need to:

1. upload the files in /data
2. Enter your wifi settings in secrets.h
